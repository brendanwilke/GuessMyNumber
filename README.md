# GuessMyNumber

**Description**

A random number is generated each time the program starts. The user can start guessing using the text box and the program will tell you if the guess is too high or too low. Your score is subtracted by 1 each time you miss a guess. Try to get your best possible score!


**Necessary Installations**

None

**Usage**
1. Use the text box above the "Check!" button to insert your guess for the number. Click on "Check!" and the program will tell you if your guess is too high or too low.
2. Based off what the program tells you, adjust your guess until you get the correct guess. The background will light up green and your highscore will be updated if it is your best score within that session.
3. If you would like to play again, click on the "Again!" button in the top left corner to reset the score and the mystery number.
